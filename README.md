# MyTamagotchi  
Launching the application:  
**cd \MyTamagotchi\out\production\MyTamagotchi  
java -jar tama.jar**  
  
All data about the pet is stored in the json file "tamagotchiState.json". If you want to test the application in different situations, you can reset all data about the created pet. If you launched the application as described earlier, then you need to copy the contents of "out/production/MyTamagotchi/tamagotchiNullState.json" to "out/production/MyTamagotchi/tamagotchiState.json"
